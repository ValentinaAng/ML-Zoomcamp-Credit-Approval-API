__________

## Project Description:  
This dataset provides information that helps us identify patterns and develop a model to determine whether a credit application will be approved.   
In this project we are using FastAPI application that includes an endpoint which accepts a InputData model and returns the prediction.
 - **API Endpoint:** `prediction/`

## Installation

To get started with the project, you need to set up the environment and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.12
- **Docker** - To containerize the application and deploy it to AWS Beanstalk.
- **AWS CLI** - For interacting with AWS install AWS CLI
- **Git** (optional, if cloning the repository)
- **Task**: To run tasks listed in the Taskfile

For instructions on how to install Task, please refer to the official guide: [Task Installation](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
  
### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ValentinaAng/ML-Zoomcamp
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Install dependencies using Poetry:**

    If you haven't installed Poetry, you can follow the installation guide on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```
## Usage

### Running the Project

After setting up the environment, you can run the project by executing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py

## Deployment to AWS Instructions

1. **Create AWS Account** 
2. **Manage IAM user permissions**
3. **Install AWS CLI** Installation link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
4. **Configure the AWS CLI** `aws configure`

**Deploy using Taskfile** 
  - To run tasks separately, use the following command: task <task_name>. Additionaly, it can be used to run all three tasks at the same time, with the following command: task full_deploy
  
The file will:
 - Build Docker image
 - (Optionally you can push the image to the ECR)
 - Initialize Elastic Beanstalk Application
 - Create environment if it doesn't exists
 - Deploy 
 

## Components

The application consists of the following components:

### Main Application Files
- **main.py**: The entry point for the FastAPI app. It initializes the app and includes routes and other application-wide configurations.
- **config/**: Directory containing configuration files for the application.
  - **logging_config.py**: Configures structured logging using `structlog` to capture detailed logs for monitoring and debugging.

### Routes
- **routers/routers.py**: Contains the applicationâ€™s route definitions.

### Pydantic Models (Schemas)
- **schemas/**: Directory containing Pydantic models used for input validation and output formatting.
  - **input.py**: Contains models to validate the data coming from the client (e.g., POST requests).
  - **output.py**: Defines models for structuring the response data returned by the API.

### Services
- **services/**: Contains logic and functionalities that handle application operations outside of the routes.
  - **latest_model.py**: Includes the logic for loading and using the latest trained model for making predictions.
  - **status_response.py**: Defines the status of prediction (e.g., 0 Approved, 1 Not Approved).

### Tests
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the application logic and API routes.
  - **test_main.py**: The main test suite for testing the API routes, responses

### Other Key Files
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker container to package and run the application in any environment.
- **pyproject.toml**: A configuration file for the Python project, listing dependencies and setup tools.
- **poetry.lock**: Lock file for Python dependencies, ensuring consistent package installations across different environments.
- **ruff.toml**: Configuration file for the `ruff` linter, used for maintaining code quality and enforcing style rules.
